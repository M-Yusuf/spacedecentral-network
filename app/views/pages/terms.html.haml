        %p Should you access or use the Platform in any way, you acknowledge and agree that you accept - without modification to any term or condition - all of the conditions set out in these T&Cs, including our operating rules, policies and procedures.  For the avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge and agree that you are bound to any rules, policies and procedures that may be published on the Website by Space Cooperative stakeholders.  
        %p Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Website.

In addition, the Website and access to the Space Decentral community is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old.
        Before reading the remainder of this Agreement, Space Decentral would like to introduce what we call the Fundamental Standard. The 
        %strong Fundamental Standard
        is the primary principle that Space Decentral encourages its community members to follow, as well as the guiding philosophy behind the Space Decentral global mission.  By familiarizing yourself with the Fundamental Standard you will be able to make an informed decision about whether to join our community.
        %h4 The Fundamental Standard
        %p Space Decentral is a distributed alliance formed to encourage investment in space exploration endeavors. We believe that participants in the Space Decentral community should embrace an attitude of open development and genuine collaboration.  We also believe that participants in this community should be rewarded for their sustained efforts toward the ends we all endorse collectively as part of Space Decentral. 
        %p
        %p The Fundamental Standard, then, is the ambitious idea that Space Decentral is a place where open development and collaboration are fairly rewarded by the community.
